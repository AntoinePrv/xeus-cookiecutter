`{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}` is a Jupyter kernel for {{cookiecutter.language}} based on the native implementation of the
Jupyter protocol [xeus](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus).

## Installation

{{cookiecutter.package_name}} has been packaged for the mamba (or conda) package manager.

To ensure that the installation works, it is preferable to install `{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}` in a
fresh environment. It is also needed to use a
[miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) or
[miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) installation because with the full
[anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) you may have a conflict with the `zeromq` library
which is already installed in the anaconda distribution.

The safest usage is to create an environment named `{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}`

```bash
mamba create -n  `{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}`
source activate  `{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}`
```

### Installing from conda-forge

Then you can install in this environment `{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}` and its dependencies

```bash
mamba install`{{cookiecutter.conda_package_name}}` notebook -c conda-forge
```

### Installing from source

Or you can install it from the sources, you will first need to install dependencies

```bash
mamba install cmake xeus nlohmann_json cppzmq xtl pybind11 pybind11_json ipython debugpy jupyterlab -c conda-forge
```

Then you can compile the sources (replace `$CONDA_PREFIX` with a custom installation
prefix if need be)

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX -D CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib -D PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=`which python`
make && make install
```

## What are the advantages of using xeus-python over ipykernel (IPython kernel)?

Check-out this blog post for the answer:
https://blog.jupyter.org/a-new-python-kernel-for-jupyter-fcdf211e30a8. Long story short:

- xeus-python is a lot lighter than ipykernel, which makes it a lot easier to implement
  new features on top of it.
- xeus-python already works with the **Jupyter Lab debugger**:
  https://github.com/jupyterlab/debugger
- xeus-based kernels are more versatile in that one can overload e.g. the concurrency
  model. This is something that Kitwareâ€™s SlicerJupyter project takes advantage of to
  integrate with the Qt event loop of their Qt-based desktop application.
